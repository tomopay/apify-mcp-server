# Resources Directory Index

This directory contains useful documents and insights about the repository architecture, design decisions, and implementation details that don't belong in code comments or JSDoc.

## Files

### [algolia.md](./algolia.md)
Technical analysis of Algolia search API responses for each documentation source.
- Data structure overview for each doc source (apify, crawlee-js, crawlee-py)
- Field availability patterns (content, hierarchy, anchors)
- Example response payloads
- Recommendations for response processing logic
- **Use case**: Understand what data is actually returned by Algolia to inform simplification decisions

### [mcp_server_refactor_analysis.md](./mcp_server_refactor_analysis.md)
Implementation plan for migrating from low-level `Server` to high-level `McpServer` API.

**Structure:**
1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview for stakeholders
2. **Executive Implementation Plan** - Technical summary for developers
3. **Detailed Implementation Guide** - Step-by-step guide for coding agents

**Key approach:** Callback-per-tool architecture where each tool's callback encapsulates its execution logic.

**Estimated effort:** 8-13 developer days

- Feature preservation matrix
- Code examples (before/after)
- Migration steps with specific file changes
- Testing strategy
- **Use case**: Reference for implementing the MCP SDK migration

### [mcp_resources_analysis.md](./mcp_resources_analysis.md)
MCP resources behavior and constraints (Skyfire readme and UI widgets), low-level `Server` API usage.
- Handler wiring and delegation to `resource_service`
- Resource list/read behavior and error handling
- **Use case**: Baseline for how resources are exposed and why

### [mcp_task_reference.md](./mcp_task_reference.md)
MCP task lifecycle, SDK features, and protocol reference for the Apify MCP server.
- Task states, protocol flow, key SDK types (`Task`, `TaskStore`, `ResponseMessage`)
- How `executeToolAndUpdateTask()` implements tasks with `mcpTaskExecution` flag
- Available but unused SDK features: resource links, dynamic resources, elicitation, completion
- Current server capabilities declaration
- Related issues: #582 (async call-actor), #587 (roadmap), #588 (tool naming)
- **Use case**: Reference when working on MCP task integration, resource links, or protocol-level features

### [patterns_for_simplification.md](./patterns_for_simplification.md)
Analysis of patterns from the **official TypeScript MCP SDK** and **FastMCP** framework that could simplify the codebase.

**Key patterns identified:**
1. **Callback-Per-Tool Registration** - Eliminate central dispatcher (~250 LOC reduction)
2. **Unified Tool Context** - Cleaner tool execution interface
3. **Zod-First Validation** - Replace AJV with direct Zod validation
4. **Automatic Notifications** - Self-managing tool list changes
5. **Progress via Context** - Simplified progress reporting
6. **Structured Error Handling** - Consistent UserError pattern
7. **Type-Safe Registration** - Generic tool definitions
8. **Session-Aware Operations** - Context-based session access

**Estimated total effort:** 10-14 days for full implementation

- Prioritized implementation phases
- Before/after code examples
- Benefits for each pattern
- **Use case**: Reference for incremental codebase improvements

### [web-widget-bundle-size.md](./web-widget-bundle-size.md)
Notes on keeping widget bundles small (narrow `@apify/ui-library` imports, markdown stack cost).
- **Use case**: When changing widget dependencies or markdown rendering, re-measure bundle impact

### [chatgpt-app-submission.md](./chatgpt-app-submission.md)
Checklist and notes for ChatGPT MCP Apps store submission (verify line references against current source before relying on them).
- **Use case**: Submission prep and audits

## Purpose

Resources in this directory serve as:
- **Technical references** for complex subsystems (e.g., Algolia integration)
- **Decision documentation** explaining why certain approaches were chosen
- **Data analysis** for optimization and refactoring efforts
- **Integration guides** for external services and APIs

## Guidelines

- Keep documents **short and technical** - avoid duplicating code logic
- Focus on **insights and patterns** rather than implementation details
- Use **tables, examples, and structured data** for clarity
- Link to relevant source files when explaining code flow
- Update when making significant changes to documented systems
